                <i>Encryption</i> is the word for taking a normal message and changing it so it is hard or impossible to read. The caesar cipher was used by the Roman emperor Julius Caesar to <i>encrypt</i> his letters.

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>Each letter in your secret message is shifted by a number you choose. For a caesar shift of 2, "A" would become "C".</p>

                <p>First decide how many letters you want to 'shift' your secret message. Let's choose a caesary shift of 1.</p>
                <img src="../static/img/training/shift1.png">
                <p>Say the secret message you want to encrypt is... "BAD", with a caesar shift of 1. To get the secret message, we will shift each letter by one place. "B" will become "C", "A will become "B", and "D" will become "E". </p>
