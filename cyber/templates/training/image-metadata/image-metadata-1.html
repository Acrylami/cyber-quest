                        <p>When you post a photo on the internet, what information do you think people can find out? You might think it's limited to what's visible in the photo, but the reality is it's possible to find out the camera you used, your name, and even your exact location.</p>

                        <p>The reason for this is something called <i>metadata</i>, also known as <i>EXIF metadata</i>. Every time you take a photo extra information is recorded in the image file. This will be hidden except to those who look for it.</p>

                        <h2>Metadata?</h2>
                        <p>It's mostly generated by the camera when you take a photo, and will stay on that photo unless you or someone else 'strips' it of this metadata. Usually, websites such as Facebook will get rid of image metadata to protect the security of their users. Otherwise, it would be incredibly easy to find out where someone lived by examining their photos metadata. </p>

                        <p>Some common types of metadata:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Date and time of photo creation</li>
                            <li>Date and time of last modification</li>
                            <li>Author of the photo</li>
                            <li>Camera make and model</li>
                            <li>Location GPS data</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>By putting together this sort of information from someone's photos, you could potentially find out where they live, where they work, where their friends live, what time they wake up and go to sleep, their name, the camera they own and much more.</p>
