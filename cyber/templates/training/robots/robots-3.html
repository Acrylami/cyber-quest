                        <h2>Benefits of robots.txt</h2>
                        <p>So now we know what robots.txt does, let's find out why it's used.</p>
                        <p>The first reason would be to hide all or parts of your website from certain search engines. Say you have a particular part of your website you don't want people to find using a search engine- you can hide that away using robots.txt. Or perhaps you really don't want your images to show up in Google Images specifically, you can do that too.</p>
                        <p>The other use could be to reduce the traffic your website gets. All the web crawlers visiting your site is traffic that your server has to handle. You can disallow crawlers on some or all of your website to reduce the traffic coming in via different bots.</p>

                        <h3>How it shouldn't be used</h3>
                        <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/web-hacking/evil-spiders.png') }}">
                        <p>A bad web developer might use robots.txt as an attempt to hide a secret part of their website from unathorised people. But although this might make it less likely that someone will stumble upon their secret page, it doesn't prevent someone from accessing it if they do find it</p>
                        <p>The challenge for this training is to navigate to the robots.txt page of this website, and find the URL of the secret page we're hiding.</p>
