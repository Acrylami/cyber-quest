                        <p>For our final password cracking challenge, you will be cracking the username as well as the password. Just as there is a list of the most common passwords, there is also a list of the most common usernames.</p>
                        <p>Rodney has set up an admin account for his online forum The Big Cheese. Unfortunately, he’s not been very creative with his login details and both his username and password are in the <b>top 5 most commonly used</b>. </p>

                        <p>Using your knowledge from the earlier challenges and your own research, can you guess Rodney’s admin account details? When you’ve managed to login, submit the FLAG to earn 100 points.</p>
