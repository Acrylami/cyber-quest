                        <p>The basic building blocks behind all your favourite websites is <i>HTML code</i>. Every website is made up of code in at least this language, but usually more! You might be thinking that the HTML code for a website would be hidden and secret- but it’s actually possible to inspect that code yourself without any tools!</p>

                        <p>Did you know that the top 25 most used passwords make up 10% of all passwords? That means if you tried every one of those 25 passwords on any account, you would have a 1 in 10 chance of hacking into the account. Scary stuff right?</p>

                        <h2>How?</h2>
                        <p>Press the F12 button on your keyboard to open developer tools. Make sure you have the <i>Elements/Inspector</i> tab selected. It should look a little something like this.</p>

                        <p>If you are using Chrome/Firefox, it is also possible to right click the part of the website you want to see the code of. Click “Inspect” and the same window as before will appear, but this time with the part of the website you clicked highlighted.</p>

                        <p>Try editing this paragraph to say anything you want! Right click, inspect element, click the dropdown arrows, then double click the text inside the &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; tags and type your message.</p>

                        <p>The changes you make this way are only temporary so will not save if you refresh the page. But it can be fun to edit your favourite sites this way and it’s a cool way to prank your friends. Here’s an example editing the headline and image code…</p>
