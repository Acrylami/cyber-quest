                        <p>CyberQuest can be used by pupils at home or in the classroom. For a more structured lesson, you may wish to make use of one of our lesson plans. Alternatively for a more open format, information on how to best support pupils is available.</p>


                        <h3>How do I get my pupils started on CyberQuest?</h3>
                        <p>All lessons and training on CyberQuest can be used without making an account, but it's highly recommended that they each register an account to allow them to track their progress, earn points, badges, and compete on the scoreboard. Account registration requires a username, email, and password.</p>
                        <p>There is no set order to complete the activities on CyberQuest, though we recommend training worth 100 points as a good place to start. Don't worry if they have no prior knowledge! The training will build up their skills from scratch.</p>

                        <h3>How do I access lesson plans?</h3>

                        <h3>How can I support my student if they get stuck?</h3>
                        <p>CyberQuest is designed to be <i>challenging</i> to encourage students to learn a new skill in order to solve the problems they are faced with. All training challenges and storyline puzzles are solvable from the information provided- if there is a storyline puzzle they struggle with, suggest the relevant training material under the "Training" section.</p>
